## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

Traditional crowdfunding platforms face significant challenges with high transaction fees, lengthy processing times, and centralized control over funds, often charging creators 5-10% of their raised capital while adding administrative complexities. These intermediaries not only increase costs but also create potential security risks and limit campaign creators' autonomy over their funds.

This project addresses these inefficiencies by developing a decentralized crowdfunding platform that leverages blockchain technology to enable direct peer-to-peer transactions. By eliminating intermediaries, the solution aims to reduce costs, enhance transparency, and provide creators with immediate access to their funds while ensuring secure, traceable transactions through smart contracts.

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

The CrowdFunding Platform enables users to:

- Create a fundraising campaign with a target amount and deadline.
- Donate directly to campaigns.
- Withdraw funds once the target is met.
- Claim refunds if the target is not reached before the deadline.
- View active and past campaigns transparently on the blockchain.

## ‚õìÔ∏è Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

- Requires Ethereum and gas fees for transactions.
- Smart contracts are immutable; upgrades require deploying new contracts.
- Refunds are only possible if the campaign fails to reach its target.
- Funds cannot be withdrawn if the target is not met.

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

- Implementing a governance system for campaign verification.
- Adding support for multiple cryptocurrencies.
- Integrating with Layer 2 solutions for reduced gas fees.
- Providing enhanced analytics for campaign performance tracking.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)
- [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/)

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/gofundme-smart-contract.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Compile the contract:
   ```sh
   npx hardhat compile
   ```
4. Deploy the contract:
