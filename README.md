## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

Traditional crowdfunding platforms face significant challenges with high transaction fees, lengthy processing times, and centralized control over funds, often charging creators 5-10% of their raised capital while adding administrative complexities. These intermediaries not only increase costs but also create potential security risks and limit campaign creators' autonomy over their funds.

This project addresses these inefficiencies by developing a decentralized crowdfunding platform that leverages blockchain technology to enable direct peer-to-peer transactions. By eliminating intermediaries, the solution aims to reduce costs, enhance transparency, and provide creators with immediate access to their funds while ensuring secure, traceable transactions through smart contracts.

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

The CrowdFunding Platform enables users to:

- Create a fundraising campaign with a target amount and deadline.
- Donate directly to campaigns.
- Withdraw funds once the target is met.
- Claim refunds if the target is not reached before the deadline.
- View active and past campaigns transparently on the blockchain.

## ‚õìÔ∏è Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

- Platform requires Electroneum cryptocurrency and ETN for gas fees, creating cost barriers
- Smart contracts are immutable - changes require new deployments with associated costs
- Refund functionality limited to campaigns that don't reach targets
- Legal uncertainties in different regions

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

- Implementing a governance system for campaign verification.
- Adding support for multiple cryptocurrencies.
- Integrating with Layer 2 solutions for reduced gas fees.
- Providing enhanced analytics for campaign performance tracking.
- Advanced funds monitoring and management
